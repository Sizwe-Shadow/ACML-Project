    "### Life expectancy at birth (years)\n",
    "The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic area. *\n",

    "The percentage of population using at least basic drinking water services, that is, the population that drinks water from an improved source, provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a round trip. This indicator encompasses both people using basic drinking water services as well as those using safely managed drinking water services. Improved water sources include piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, and packaged or delivered water.\n",

    "Recorded APC is defined as the recorded amount of alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years) over a calendar year in a country, in litres of pure alcohol. The indicator only takes into account the consumption which is recorded from production, import, export, and sales data often via taxation. Numerator: The amount of recorded alcohol consumed per capita (15+ years) during a calendar year, in litres of pure alcohol. Denominator: Midyear resident population (15+ years) for the same calendar year, UN World Population Prospects, medium variant.\n",

This indicator encompasses both people using basic sanitation services as well as those using safely managed sanitation services. Improved sanitation facilities include flush/pour flush toilets connected to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines; pit latrines with slabs (including ventilated pit latrines), and composting toilets.\n",

Each dose increases the level and protection against tetanus. It is assumed that a newborn is protected against tetanus at birth if the total of all doses received, including those during the last pregnancy, are as follows: • 2 doses and last dose was 3 years or less prior to the most recent delivery • 3 doses and last dose was 5 years or less prior to the most recent delivery • 4 doses and last dose was 10 years or less prior to the most recent delivery • 5 or more doses ever.\n",
